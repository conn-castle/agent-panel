//
//  Thread-safe circuit breaker for AeroSpace CLI commands.
//
//  When AeroSpace becomes unresponsive (crashes, socket dies), every subsequent
//  CLI command times out at 5s each. With 15-20 calls in a Doctor check, this
//  creates a ~90s freeze cascade. The circuit breaker detects the first timeout
//  and immediately fails subsequent calls for a cooldown period.
//

/// - **Closed**: Normal operation. All commands pass through.
/// - **Open**: Tripped by a timeout. All commands fail immediately until cooldown expires.
