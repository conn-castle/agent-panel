# Issues

Note: This is an agent-layer memory file. It is primarily for agent use.

## Purpose
Deferred defects, maintainability refactors, technical debt, risks, and engineering concerns. Add an entry only when you are not fixing it now.

## Format
- Insert new entries immediately below `<!-- ENTRIES START -->` (most recent first).
- Keep each entry **3–5 lines**.
- Line 1 starts with `- Issue YYYY-MM-DD <id>:` and a short title.
- Lines 2–5 are indented by **4 spaces** and use `Key: Value`.
- Keep **exactly one blank line** between entries.
- Prevent duplicates: search the file and merge/rewrite instead of adding near-duplicates.
- When fixed, remove the entry from this file.

### Entry template

    Priority: Critical | High | Medium | Low. Area: <area>
    Description: <observed problem or risk>

## Open issues

- Issue 2026-02-03 doctorsev: Doctor VS Code/Chrome checks should FAIL when a project needs them
    Priority: Medium. Area: Doctor
    Description: VS Code and Chrome checks are currently WARN. They should be FAIL if any configured project would use them (same logic as the agent-layer CLI check).
    Next step: Add project config fields to specify IDE/browser requirements, then check those fields in Doctor and fail if the required app is missing.
    Notes: Blocked until project config schema includes IDE/browser requirements.
