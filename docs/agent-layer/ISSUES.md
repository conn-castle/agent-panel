- Issue 2026-01-28 b7v1s3: Brittle switcher visibility check
    Priority: Low. Area: ProjectWorkspacesApp
    Description: SwitcherPanelController.scheduleVisibilityCheck uses a hardcoded 0.15s delay to verify panel visibility, which is brittle on loaded systems and may cause false positive logs.
    Next Step: Replace the fixed delay with event-based observation (e.g., NSWindow.didBecomeKeyNotification) or document the limitation.
    Notes: Currently affects diagnostics only, not user functionality.
