# Commands

Purpose: Canonical, repeatable commands for this repository.

Notes for updates:
- Add commands that are expected to be used repeatedly (setup, development server, build, lint, format, typecheck, tests, coverage, database migrations, common scripts).
- Include purpose, command, where to run it, and prerequisites.
- Keep entries concise and deduplicated.
- Do not add one-off debugging commands.
